V23.15  [13 September 2024]

    Changed the way the app looks for data files.  The data files are stored in month directories with a year directory.
    I now store the year and month separately, and build the filename for there - this can then be supplied via command line.
    This should allow the app the run a script and batch build several months at once.
    config - changed the DATA options from directory, mainWB, mainDB and target to
                 data_dir, rec_dir, month, year and target.
                 Changed to config.toml and config.py.
    args.py - Added option -C to print out the current config values.
              Added options -m & -y to pass in the month and year of the data.
    dataUtils.py - added functions printConfig() and buildFileNames()
    monthlyRecords.py & allTimeRecords.py - class to store highLows - to be used.


V23.14  [12 September 2023]

    Moved classes\sql3Report.py to src.
    Moved src\weatherDatapy to classes.
    args.py          - args.Version now uses utils.logPrint().
                       args.report can now have a second argument, a filename to report on.
    sql3Report.py    - Start of the reporting process.  Contains initial log to scan the months database.
    sql3Data.py      - The highLows table no longer stores the date.
                       The fetchall() was renamed to count() - that's what it did.
                       A fetchone() was added.
    allTimeRecors.py - A class to hold the all time high and lows.
    dataClasses.py   - The __post_init__ now checks values are numeric and not just floats.
                           Some values where being passed in as ints.


V23.13

    sql3Data.py     - Added a second table to store the high and lows for the month.
                      Added an index column [integer on autoincrement] to each table.
    dataSQLBuild.py - Amended so that the create mode returns after calling create


V23.12

    agrs.py      - Added an extra command line argument -c, this creates the sql tables.
                   Use this at start to initialise a new database [or to clear the database].
    main.py      - The sql build is now called from a try exception block.  Catches no tables error [see above].
                   Sql version printed in verbose mode if build in sql.
    dataUtils.py - added function to return slq version.
    sql3Data.py  - Added try exception block to fetchall function.
    sqlReport.py - New file, will report on highs and lows in sql mode.


V23.11

    Added the ability to store the aggregate data in sqlite3 as well as excel.
    Renamed dataBuild.py to dataXbuild.py and dataReport.py to dataXreport.pt - to store and report on Excell data.
    Added dataSQLBuild.py to store the data in a sqlite3 database.
        This mimics dataXbuild.pt by looping through the daily spreadsheets, but writes to a sqlite3 database.
    Added a command line argument -c [-create] to create the initial sqlite3 database and tables.
        This could be combined, so -cbr [create - build - report] will work.


V23.10

    Added the python package rich.
        Rich is a Python library for writing rich text (with colour and style) to the terminal,
        and for displaying advanced content such as tables, markdown, and syntax highlighted code.
        The configuration of such is a console class in src.console.py
    Removed the use of colorama.
    Added a command line arguments -v [--verbose] to control the amount of detail displayed.
    Changes to source files to reflect the two above additions.


V23.9

    Added utils function maxMin(), given a values and the current record will return the new record.
        Also return the corresponding date.
    Added a __post_init__ function to the data class weatherValues.
        This checks each values is a float, if not sets the values to a float (currently 200.00).
    dataReport.py now displays the max and min values for outdoor and indoor temperatures plus rain rate.


V23.8

    Added dataReport.py - will be the report part of the app. This will find the highs and lows.
        This is loosely based on dataBuild.py.
    Added arguments to main.py to either call build or report (should call build and then report).


V23.7

    Converted weatherValues class to be a dataClass.
        Makes the logic in weatherData simple and clean.


V23.6

    Changed the way the spreadsheet is read in weatherData.py from reading a row at a time
    to reading individual cells values.  This method returns actual value type i.e floats
    and not strings.  This will be useful in the reporting app.
    Added logPrint to src.utils.dataUtils.  This allows the same message to be
    displayed and logged - reduces duplicate code.


V23.5

    Renamed some of the source files to have a prefix of build [a report app coming soon).
    Added the config options
        for the location and name for the main spreadsheet.
        for the glob string for the target files( that are merged into the main spreadsheet.)
    Moved the pyDataBuild.py into the src directory.
    Created a main.py that sets things up and calls pyDataBuild.


V23.4

    Added to WeatherData class.
        __contains__ - checks to see if a given data set is in the data dictionary.
        add()        - adds data to the data dictionary.
        saveData     - saves the dictionary to a spreadsheet
        saveDataJson - saves the dictionary to a text file using json, uses a custom json encoder.

    The spreadsheets are now loaded correctly and their data is added to the main dictionary if not already included.


V23.3

    Added to WeatherData class.
        countData() - Return the number of entries in the dictionary.
        nextRow()   - Returns the data in the dictionary, one line at a time.

    The spreadsheets are now loaded into classes and make their data available one row at a time.


V23.2

    Created a class WeatherData in weatherData.py.
        This will hold the data form a single spreadsheet of weather data, typically daily; held in a dictionaryrm *.json.
        It will also contain the necessary methods to manipulate the data.  i.e. load, add etc.
        Only loadFile and loadData so far.
    Created a class weatherValues in dataClasses.py.
        This will hold the data from a single row of the spreadsheet.
    Created a data mapping in dataMapping.
        This is a mappings for the weather spreadsheet column headers.

    The spreadsheet load into weatherData class, but still working on loading the rows.

    Also source passes ruff check - I ignore the 80 column line limit, I have a wide monitor ;-)


V23.1

    Basic framework - taken from pyMp3Duplicate.
    App excepts command line arguments -h, -l, -e only.
    Only config options are name and version number.
    Creates a logger file in the logs directory.

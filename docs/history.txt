V23.5

    Renamed some of the source files to have a prefix of build [a report app coming soon).
    Added the config options
        for the location and name for the main spreadsheet.
        for the glob string for the target files( that are merged into the main spreadsheet.)
    Moved the pyDataBuild.py into the src directory.
    Created a main.py that sets things up and calls pyDataBuild.


V23.4

    Added to WeatherData class.
        __contains__ - checks to see if a given data set is in the data dictionary.
        add()        - adds data to the data dictionary.
        saveData     - saves the dictionary to a spreadsheet
        saveDataJson - saves the dictionary to a text file using json, uses a custom json encoder.

    The spreadsheets are now loaded correctly and their data is added to the main dictionary if not already included.


V23.3

    Added to WeatherData class.
        countData() - Return the number of entries in the dictionary.
        nextRow()   - Returns the data in the dictionary, one line at a time.

    The spreadsheets are now loaded into classes and make their data available one row at a time.


V23.2

    Created a class WeatherData in weatherData.py.
        This will hold the data form a single spreadsheet of weather data, typically daily; held in a dictionaryrm *.json.
        It will also contain the necessary methods to manipulate the data.  i.e. load, add etc.
        Only loadFile and loadData so far.
    Created a class weatherValues in dataClasses.py.
        This will hold the data from a single row of the spreadsheet.
    Created a data mapping in dataMapping.
        This is a mappings for the weather spreadsheet column headers.

    The spreadsheet load into weatherData class, but still working on loading the rows.

    Also source passes ruff check - I ignore the 80 column line limit, I have a wide monitor ;-)


V23.1

    Basic framework - taken from pyMp3Duplicate.
    App excepts command line arguments -h, -l, -e only.
    Only config options are name and version number.
    Creates a logger file in the logs directory.
